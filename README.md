### Form Processing Scenario
#### Voice-Driven Form Completion
1. **Form Initialization**
   User has three options to start form processing:
   - Reference previously uploaded form: "Fill out my saved W-9 form"
   - Request new form creation: "Create a new employee onboarding form"
   - Request form discovery: "Find the latest I-485 immigration form"

2. **Form Acquisition**
   System responds based on request type:
   - **Saved Forms**: Retrieves from user's form library in Supabase
   - **New Forms**: Generates structured form based on requirements
   - **External Forms**: 
     - Searches official sources for latest version
     - Downloads and processes form structure
     - Validates form authenticity

3. **Interactive Form Filling**
   - System initiates conversational form filling:
     ```
     System: "Let's fill out your W-9 form. What's your full legal name?"
     User: "John Michael Smith"
     System: "Thanks. Is your business a sole proprietorship or corporation?"
     User: "Sole proprietorship"
     System: "Got it. What's your current mailing address?"
     ```
   - Handles complex field dependencies
   - Validates input against form requirements
   - Provides field explanations when needed

4. **Progress Management**
   - Saves progress automatically after each field
   - Allows pause/resume at any point:
     ```
     User: "Let's pause here, I'll complete the rest later"
     System: "Progress saved. We've completed 60% of the form, 
             remaining fields: SSN and signature"
     ```
   - Maintains form state in database

5. **Completion Options**
   - **Partial Completion**:
     - Saves current progress
     - Lists remaining required fields
     - Sets reminder for completion
   
   - **Full Completion**:
     - Generates filled form PDF
     - Stores in Google Drive
     - Sends confirmation with access link

6. **Follow-up Actions**
   - Schedules reminders for incomplete forms
   - Notifies of approaching deadlines
   - Suggests related forms if needed
   - Maintains form version history

## Usage Flow Examples

### Complex Research Scenario
#### On-the-Go Research Request
1. **Voice Initiation**
   - User speaks to NTFY app on iPhone while driving
   - System establishes conversation thread and maintains context
   - Research requirements are clarified through natural dialogue
